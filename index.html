            The Statue of Unity is a monument located in the state of Gujarat, India. It is a colossal statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was one of the founding fathers of the Indian Republic and served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India.

The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, standing at a height of 182 meters (597 feet) from its base to the tip of the statue's flagstaff. The statue was inaugurated on October 31, 2018, by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, on the occasion of Patel's 143rd birth anniversary.

The statue is located on a river island called Sadhu Bet, near the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river. It is surrounded by a 12 km² artificial lake created by raising the level of the river.

The construction of the Statue of Unity began in 2013 and took almost five years to complete. The statue was built by a consortium of Indian engineering and construction companies, with the help of Chinese experts.

The statue is made of bronze cladding on a steel frame and is designed to withstand earthquakes and strong winds. It is designed to last for at least 100 years.

The Statue of Unity has become a major tourist attraction in India, drawing millions of visitors every year. It has also become a symbol of India's unity and a tribute to Patel's role in the country's struggle for independence and his efforts to unite the nation after independence.
